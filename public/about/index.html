  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I have worn a number of hats over my admittedly, short career so far!</p>
<p>I had studied Accounting and Information Technology at University and have jumped between these areas over the past few years.</p>
<p>I found myself in a lot of typical accounting roles encompassing taxation, auditing, financial and management accounting, for both large and small companies, and the public sector.</p>
<p>However, after a few years, I had found myself more and more interested in technology, and specifically, data science &amp; engineering. I would eventually transition to working in the public sector within the data space.</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoy learning about technology even outside of my professional career, and have found myself passionate about the sciences broadly, which I hope to write on more about in the future!</p>
<p>Outside of those somewhat nerdy or boring interests, I also enjoy Music (of various genres) and Video Games!</p>
