Welcome to my (HobbyMath42's) personal website and blog!

I hope to use this site as a way to document some (hopefully) interesting projects and my thoughts on various topics that interest me at the time!

My goal with this website is to both improve my writing skills as well as to hopefully assist others with gaining insight into topics that they may be interested in!

The initial focus of projects and other posts is intended to be around technology, but I also hope to extend this to other topics outside of just tech!

Feel free to peruse this site as you wish and I hope you gain something from your time here! :)
