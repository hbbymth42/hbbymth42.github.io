title = 'ASGS GeoNames Data Pipeline'
draft = false
+++

A Data Pipeline created to geocode data from [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/) and create relevant boundary files from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)' [Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS)](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/statistical-geography/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs).

Started off initially as a component of another project but soon turned into its own project!

Code for the Pipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/hbbymth42/asgs_geonames_pipeline)!
