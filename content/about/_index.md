I have worn a number of hats over my admittedly, short career so far!

I had studied Accounting and Information Technology at University and have jumped between these areas over the past few years.

I found myself in a lot of typical accounting roles encompassing taxation, auditing, financial and management accounting, for both large and small companies, and the public sector.

However, after a few years, I had found myself more and more interested in technology, and specifically, data science & engineering. I would eventually transition to working in the public sector within the data space.

Personally, I enjoy learning about technology even outside of my professional career, and have found myself passionate about the sciences broadly, which I hope to write on more about in the future!

Outside of those somewhat nerdy or boring interests, I also enjoy Music (of various genres) and Video Games!
